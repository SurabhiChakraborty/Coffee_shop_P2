# Coffee Shop

## Project overview

This project is built around a fictional coffee shop database named `monday_coffee_db`. It contains realistic business data related to products, sales, customers, and city demographics. The purpose of this project is to practice SQL querying skills by extracting meaningful insights for business decisions.


## Database Structure

The database consists of **4 tables**:

### 1. `city`
- `city_id` (Primary Key)
- `city_name`
- `population`
- `estimated_rent`
- `city_rank`

### 2. `products`
- `product_id` (Primary Key)
- `product_name`
- `price`

### 3. `customers`
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_name`
- `city_id` (Foreign Key)

### 4. `sales`
- `sale_id` (Primary Key)
- `sale_date`
- `product_id` (Foreign Key)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key)
- `total`
- `rating`
